            <summary>
            Contains information about how to map SIDs from untrusted forest during access checks.<br/>
            Identity from untrusted forest must be mapped explicitly to user from AD forest where PDS is installed (or any other trusted forest)<br/>
            When calling PDS interface, SID mappings help to validate caller's permissions on objects in untrusted forests.
